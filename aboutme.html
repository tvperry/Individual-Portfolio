        <p>Thanks for checking my website out! As I said, I'm Tess and I am a product designer. 
            Currently, I am a junior at the University of Michigan studying User Experience Design 
            and Research at the School of Information. At the School of Information, we are focused on the intersection of people, information 
            and technology by developing both hard and soft skills, from coding, statistics, information and data analysis to communication,  
            collaboration and creative problem-solving. On campus, you can usually find me drinking a lavender latte at the many 
            coffee shops on campus, at Yost watching a hockey game little too aggressively or meandering around the streets of Ann Arbor 
            looking for a dog to pet.</p> <br/>
        <p> I try to take an empathic approach to all my work to try and best understand the user and how my work can support them. 
            I developed this philosophy from my role as a research assistant to a professor at the School of Information, where we developing 
            an application to help children in special education systems acquire skills in self-management to transition into regular education </p> <br/>
        <p> My empathic approach was refined this past summer while interning at URBN home office, a multinational retail company, where I was an 
            SEO researcher and writer for shared services. During my time there, I was responsible for writing SEO recommendation reports for all 
            new pages to the brands’ sites on suggested metadata, page assets, and linking. Additionally, in HTML I updated meta tags, 
            href lang tags, and body copy on various web developers for the brands. I also presented specific SEO optimization recommendations for each brand. </p> <br/>
        <p>From my research, internship, and school work, I have become very skilled at developing high-fidelity mockups, user flows, wireframes, 
          prototypes, writing interview protocols, and SEO research. Additionally, I have hard skills in python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and know 
          how to work with Google Analytics, Sketch, Figma, and other applications</p><br/>
        <p>If you’re interested in chatting, please reach out and check out the work I have done so far!</p>
